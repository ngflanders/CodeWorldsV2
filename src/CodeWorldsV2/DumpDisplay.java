/* Display keeps track of a list of Displayables, and produces, on each
 * |update| call, a textual 2-D display of their location, showing the toString
 * value of each Displayable at its current location, with X location ascending
 * across columns, and Y location *down* rows. (Computations are easier that
 * way, and an upside-down display looks as good.)  Each row and column 
 * represent a step in location-space of some size, not necessarily 1.0.  This
 * allows larger location-space spans to be shown in a limited number of rows
 * and columns, at the expense of some loss of resolution.
 * 
 * If any Displayable falls outside the allowed index range, simply drop it
 * from the display.
